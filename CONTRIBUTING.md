## Note for Naming Rule

### Branch

You can create several other child branches to implement source code for functions/features and/or unit tests and/or user guides.

The format of the Branch Name is as follows:
```sh

```
For example:
```sh
origin/master/v1.1.0
  |__origin/master/v1.1.0_Button_src
  |__origin/master/v1.1.0_Button_unit_test
  |__origin/master/v1.1.0_Button_docs
  |__origin/master/v1.1.0_Notification_docs
  |__origin/master/v1.1.0_Text_src
```
### Pull Request

If you finish the implementation under the child branches, you should merge from the parent branch before creating a pull request against it.<br>

The format of the Pull Request Title is as follows:
```sh
[Pull Request Type] Title

Pull Request types are as follows:
| Type | Example |
| :---- | :---- |
