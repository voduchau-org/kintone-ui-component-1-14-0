## Topics to share!

### Release new components
We added several new components together this time!<br/>
About Date/Time series components, we considered it will be useful to provide each separately for property setting and leaning cost reasons.

About Dialog, we set the default size small, so you can utilize it on both desktop and mobile screens.

### Accept duplicated value
For choice components, we updated the specification to accept duplicated value in `value` and `Item.value` properties. (We used to throw error if it is duplicated.)<br/>
And for that, we newly added the `selectedIndex` property to distinguish which duplicated value item will be selected.<br/>
You can utilize the feature for example when you want to categorize by value and switch the display.
